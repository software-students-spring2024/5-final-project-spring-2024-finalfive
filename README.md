## Description

Our Web App, Stats Preacher, is an AI app that can provide easy-to-read sports-related information 
to t he user based on user queries written in the natural language. 

While it is difficult for LLM like ChatGPT to provide updates sports statistics due to  lack of relevant information, Out app allows ChatGPT to gain access to sport statistics from statmuse to provide an accurate and consise analysis of the user's queries.

Furthermore, the app allows you to save selected queries that the user may find interesting to their profile. You can even add a friend on the app and view their selected queries.
