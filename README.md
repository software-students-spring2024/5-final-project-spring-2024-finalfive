## Description

# Statemates

Statemates is an AI-powered web application designed to provide easy-to-read, sports-related information based on user queries written in natural language. 

Unlike large language models such as ChatGPT, which may struggle to provide updated sports statistics due to a lack of relevant sports information, Statemates bridges this gap. It allows ChatGPT to access sports statistics from Statmuse, ensuring accurate and concise analysis of user queries.

In addition to providing sports statistics, Statemates offers a range of user-friendly features. Users can save queries that they find interesting to their profile for easy access later. The application also supports a social aspect, allowing users to add friends and view their selected queries.

Stay tuned for more exciting features as we continue to develop and improve Statemates!
